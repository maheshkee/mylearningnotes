<body><p>ALL THE KEY COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED USING PCB THROUGH PRINTED CIRCUITS, CONCEPTUALLY WE USE BUS, BUS IS USED TO TRANSFER DATA AND ADRESSES BETWEEN CPU AND OTHER COMPONENTS. <br>CPU CONSISTS OF SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS. THESE ARE: CU - CONTROL UNIT<br>ALU - ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT<br> REGISTERS - R1,R2, PC(PROGRAM COUNTER  AKA IP), IR - INSTRUCTION REGISTER. <br> THESE REGISTERS ARE USED TO STORE DATA AND ADRESSES TEMPORARILY DURING PROCESS. <br>WHEN A PROCESS STARTS WHICH IS LOADED BY USING A LOADER FROM OS INTO RAM, OS SETS PC BASE ADRESS. CU SENDS THIS ADDRESS USING BUS TO RAM AND RAM READ THE INSTRUCTION IN THAT ADDRESS AND SENDS TO CU. THIS INSTRUCTION IS BASICALLY TWO PARTS, ONE PART BEING OPCODE WHICH IS OPERATION INSTRUCTION AND OTHER PART WILL BE OPERAND ON WHICH THSI OPERATION WORKS WHICH CAN EITHER BE DATA OR ADDRESS. NOW THIS INSTRUCTION WILL FIRST GO TO IR TEMPORARIY REGISTER AND CU READS FROM THERE AND UNDERSTANDS AND EXECUTES THAT. SUPPOSE IF THAT INSTRUCTUIN WANTS ADD OR MULTIPLY THEN ALU IS SIGNALED AND ALU OPERATES ON DATA INSIDE R1, R2 REGISTERS, AND IF THAT OPERATION IS TO READ DATA AND RESPECTIVE DATA WILL BE BROUGHT FROM RAM OR KEYBOARD(WITH HELP OF OS) THROUGH BUS AND GOES TO THE REGISTERS.<br></p>

<img src="../SYSINTRNLS.png"/>                     <p>THE COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND ONLY 1,0 SO EVERY TRANSFER WILL BE IN THESE TWO BITS ONLY. <br> EITHER ZERO OR ONES. BUT FOR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING WE USE HEXA DECIMAL REPRESANTATION. 8 BITS CONSTITUE ONE BYTE. TWO HEXA DIGITS CAN BE USED TO REPRESNT THESE 8 BITS. IN RAM MEMORY WILL  SEGMENTED FOR DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE CODE OF A PROGRAM. A PROGRAM DURING EXECUTION WILL CALLED AS PROCESS. THE INSTRUCTION.</p> <p>WHEN WE RUN A PROGRAM OS LOADS OUR PROGRAM FROM HARD DISK TO RAM MEMORY WHERE SEGMENTATIO HAPPENS AND MEMORY WILL BE ALLOTED FOR DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF CODE</p><br><h2>SEGMENTATION</h2><p>THE CODE WE WRITE WILL BE COPILED INTO SECTION DURING COMPILING. TEXT OR CODE WILL BE ONE SECTION AND DATA WILL BE ANOTHER SECTION.THE CODE PART OF PROGRAM WILL BE IN ONE SEGMENT IN MEMORY, THE GLOBAL VARIABLE WILL BE IN DATA SEGMENT. ALSO FOR EVERY FUNCTION ONE FRAME WILL BE CREATED IN STACK MEMORY AND THERE WILL BE HEAP MEMORY TO ALLOCATE MEMORY DYNAMICALLY.</p><br><P> SO TYPICALLY DATA IN RAM FOR A PROGRAM WILL BE SEGMENTED INTO FOUR PARTS. AND EVERY TIME A FUNXTION IS CALLED A MEMORY FRAM WILL BE CREATED IN STACK MEMORY AND WHEN THE FUNCTION IS OVER AND RETURNED TO CALLERS ADDRESS THE MEMORY FRAME OF THAT FUNCTION WILL BE POPPED AND MEMORY WILL BE FREE. EACH STACK OF A FUNCTION FRAME WILL TYPICALLY RETURN ADDRESS AND LOCAL VARIABLES OF THAT FUCTION. </p>

<h2> FUNCTIONS IN C </h2><P>A Function is a block of set of instruction in a program which can be used again and again. To avoid writing reusable code multiple times we simply write them under a function and we can use that any number of times by simple using the functions name.
 </p> <h3>KEY PARTS OF FUNCTION</h3><p>Basically a function has three important features. One is Declaration. Second one is Definition. Third one is calling. </p><img src="../functionstruct.jpg"> </body>
